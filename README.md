# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

This project is scaffolded so that you can build a React frontend and Rails
backend together, and easily deploy them to Render.

**Note**: if you are not planning to deploy your app to Render and prefer to use
SQLite, you will need to make the following changes in the project files:

1. In the `Gemfile`, replace `gem 'pg', '~> 1.1'` with `gem 'sqlite3', '~>
   1.4'`.
2. In the `database.yml` file, change the line `adapter: postgresql` to
   `adapter: sqlite3`.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.4
- NodeJS (v16), and npm
- Render account
- Postgresql

See Environment Setup below for instructions on installing these tools if you
don't already have them.

## Setup

Start by **cloning** (not forking) the project template repository and removing
the remote:

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-curriculum/project-template-react-rails-api.git your-project-name
$ cd your-project-name
$ git remote rm origin
```

Then, [create a new remote repository][create repo] on GitHub. Head to
[github.com](https://github.com) and click the **+** icon in the top-right
corner and follow the steps to create a new repository. **Important**: don't
check any of the options such as 'Add a README file', 'Add a .gitignore file',
etc. â€” since you're importing an existing repository, creating any of those
files on GitHub will cause issues.

[create repo]: https://docs.github.com/en/github/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line#adding-a-project-to-github-without-github-cli

If you're working with a partner,
[add them as a collaborator][add collaborator] on GitHub. From your repo on
GitHub, go to Settings > Manage Access > Invite a collaborator and enter your
partner's username. Once your partner has access, they should git **clone** (not
fork) the repository.

[add collaborator]: https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository

Finally, connect the GitHub remote repository to your local repository and push
up your code:

```console
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:your-username/your-project-name.git
$ git push -u origin main
```

When you're ready to start building your project, run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

Make sure to also update this README to include documentation about
your project. Here's a list of some [awesome readmes][] for inspiration.

## Deploying

This application has all the starter code needed to help you deploy your
application to Render. It's recommended to deploy your project early and push up
changes often to ensure that your code works equally well in production and
development environments.

The instructions in this section assume that you've already set up a Render
account, created a PostgreSQL instance in your account, and set up your
environment to deploy to Render. If you have not yet completed these steps, see
the Environment Setup section below.

### Create a Master Key File

In the project files, delete the `config/credentials.yml.enc` file. Then, in the
terminal, run the following:

```sh
$ EDITOR="code --wait" bin/rails credentials:edit
```

**Note**: if you use a different text editor than VS Code, you will need to replace
`code` with the appropriate command.

The command above will open a file in VS Code and wait for you to close it
before completing the process of creating the credential files. Once you've done
that, you should see both the `credentials.yml.enc` and `master.key` files in
the `config` folder. You will need the value in the `master.key` file to set up
the web service in Render.

Commit your changes and push them to GitHub.

### Create the App Database

Render allows users to create [multiple databases within a single PostgreSQL
instance][multiple dbs] using the PostgreSQL interactive terminal,
[`psql`][psql].

Navigate to your PostgreSQL instance from the Render dashboard, click the
"Connect" dropdown, then the External Connection tab, and copy the PSQL command.
Paste it into your terminal and press enter. This command connects you to the
remote PostgreSQL instance.

To create the database, run this SQL command:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE new_db_name;
```

Now if you run `\l` from the PSQL prompt, you should see a table that includes
your main PostgreSQL instance as well as the database you just created.

Run the `\q` command to exit PSQL.

[multiple dbs]: https://render.com/docs/databases#multiple-databases-in-a-single-postgresql-instance
[psql]: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html

### Create the Render Web Service

To deploy, click the "New +" button in Render and select "Web Service". You'll
see a list of all the repositories in your GitHub account. Find the repo you
want to deploy and click the "Select" button.

In the page that opens, enter a name for your app and make sure the Environment
is set to Ruby.

Scroll down and set the Build Command to `./bin/render-build.sh` and the Start
Command to `bundle exec puma -C config/puma.rb`.

Open a separate tab in your browser, navigate to the Render dashboard, and click
on your PostgreSQL instance. Scroll down to the "Connection" section, find the
"Internal Database URL", and copy it.

Return to the other tab. Scroll down and click the "Advanced" button, then click
"Add Environment Variable." Enter `DATABASE_URL` as the key, then paste in the
URL you just copied. Note that the URL will end with the name you gave your
PostgreSQL instance when you initially created it; be sure to remove that name
and replace it with the name of the database you created in the last section.

Click "Add Environment Variable" again. Add `RAILS_MASTER_KEY` as the key, and
paste the value in the `config/master.key` file you created earlier.

The completed page should look like this:

![Web service settings](https://curriculum-content.s3.amazonaws.com/phase-4/project-template/web-service-settings.png)

Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click "Create Web Service". The deploy
process will begin automatically.

## Environment Setup

### Install the Latest Ruby Version

Verify which version of Ruby you're running by entering this in the terminal:

```console
$ ruby -v
```

We recommend version 2.7.4. If you need to upgrade you can install it using rvm:

```console
$ rvm install 2.7.4 --default
```

You should also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```console
$ gem install bundler
$ gem install rails
```

### Install NodeJS

Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```sh
node -v
```

If your Node version is not 16.x.x, install it and set it as the current and
default version with:

```sh
nvm install 16
nvm use 16
nvm alias default 16
```

You can also update your npm version with:

```sh
npm i -g npm
```

### Install Postgresql

Render requires that you use PostgreSQL for your database instead of SQLite.
PostgreSQL (or just Postgres for short) is an advanced database management
system with more features than SQLite. If you don't already have it installed,
you'll need to set it up.

#### PostgreSQL Installation for WSL

To install Postgres for WSL, run the following commands from your Ubuntu terminal:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib libpq-dev
```

Then confirm that Postgres was installed successfully:

```sh
psql --version
```

Run this command to start the Postgres service:

```sh
sudo service postgresql start
```

Finally, you'll also need to create a database user so that you are able to
connect to the database from Rails. First, check what your operating system
username is:

```sh
whoami
```

If your username is "ian", for example, you'd need to create a Postgres user
with that same name. To do so, run this command to open the Postgres CLI:

```sh
sudo -u postgres -i
```

From the Postgres CLI, run this command (replacing "ian" with your username):

```sh
createuser -sr ian
```

Then enter `control + d` or type `logout` to exit.

[This guide][postgresql wsl] has more info on setting up Postgres on WSL if you
get stuck.

[postgresql wsl]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-postgresql

#### Postgresql Installation for OSX

To install Postgres for OSX, you can use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

Once Postgres has been installed, run this command to start the Postgres
service:

```sh
brew services start postgresql
```

### Set Up a Render Account

You can sign up for a free account at
[https://dashboard.render.com/register][Render signup]. We recommend that you
sign up using GitHub as that will make it a little easier for you to connect
Render to your GitHub account. The instructions below assume you've done that.

[Render signup]: https://dashboard.render.com/register

Once you've completed the signup process, you will be taken to the Render
dashboard. In order to connect Render to your GitHub account, you'll need to
click the "New Web Service" button in the "Web Services" box. On the next page,
you will see a GitHub heading on the right side and below that a link labeled
"Connect account". (If you didn't sign up using GitHub, it will say "Connect
account" instead.) Click that link, then in the modal that appears click
"Install." You should then be taken back to the "Create a New Web Service" page,
which should now show a list of your GitHub repos. We won't actually create a
web service just yet so you are free to navigate away from the page at this
point.

Next, we'll set up a PostgreSQL instance. Click the "New +" button at the top of
the page and select "PostgreSQL". Enter a name for your PostgreSQL instance. The
remaining fields can be left as is. Click "Create Database" at the bottom of the
page. You should now be all set to follow the steps in the "Deploying" section.

## Troubleshooting

If you ran into any errors along the way, here are some things you can try to
troubleshoot:

- If you're on a Mac and got a server connection error when you tried to run
  `rails db:create`, one option for solving this problem for Mac users is to
  install the Postgres app. To do this, first uninstall `postgresql` by running
  `brew remove postgresql`. Next, download the app from the
  [Postgres downloads page][] and install it. Launch the app and click
  "Initialize" to create a new server. You should now be able to run
  `rails db:create`.

- If you're using WSL and got the following error running `rails db:create`:

  ```txt
  PG::ConnectionBad: FATAL:  role "yourusername" does not exist
  ```

  The issue is that you did not create a role in Postgres for the default user
  account. Check [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQC5izDzOgE) for
  one possible fix.

- If your app failed to deploy at the build stage, make sure your local
  environment is set up correctly by following the steps at the beginning of
  this lesson. Check that you have the latest versions of Ruby and Bundler, and
  ensure that PostgreSQL was installed successfully.

- If you deployed successfully, but you ran into issues when you visited the
  site, make sure you migrated and seeded the database. Also, make sure that
  your application works locally and try to debug any issues on your local
  machine before re-deploying. You can also check the deployment log on the
  app's page in the Render dashboard.
