# Project Template: React/Rails API

## Description

This project is scaffolded so that you can build a React frontend and Rails
backend together, and easily deploy them to Heroku.

## Requirements

- Ruby 2.7.3
- NodeJS (v14 or higher), and npm
- Heroku CLI
- Postgresql

See [Environment Setup](#environment-setup) below for instructions on installing
these tools if you don't already have them.

## Setup

**Fork and clone this repository**.

Then run:

```sh
bundle install
rails db:create
npm install --prefix client
```

You can use the following commands to run the application:

- `rails s`: run the backend on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- `npm start --prefix client`: run the frontend on
  [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- `rails start`: run the frontend and backend together with one command

Make sure to also update this README to include documentation about
your project. Here's a list of some [awesome readmes][] for inspiration.

## Deploying

This application has all the starter code needed to help you deploy your
application to Heroku. It's recommended to deploy your project early and push up
changes often to ensure that your code works equally well in production and
development environments.

To deploy, first log in to your Heroku account using the Heroku CLI:

```sh
heroku login
```

Create the new Heroku app:

```sh
heroku create my-app-name
```

Add the builds for Heroku to run the Rails app on Ruby and build the React app
on Node:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/nodejs --index 1
heroku buildpacks:add heroku/ruby --index 2
```

To deploy, commit your code and push the changes to Heroku:

```sh
git add .
git commit -m 'Commit message'
git push heroku main
```

> Note: depending on your Git configuration, your default branch might be named
> `master` or `main`. You can verify which by running
> `git branch --show-current`. If it's `master`, you'll need to run
> `git push heroku master` instead.

Any time you have changes to deploy, just make sure your changes are committed
on the main branch of your repo, and push those changes to Heroku to deploy
them.

You can view your deployed app with:

```sh
heroku open
```

## Environment Setup

### Ruby

Ensure you are running the
[latest Ruby release supported by Heroku][heroku ruby]. At the time of writing,
that's `2.7.3`. You can verify with:

```sh
ruby -v
```

If you don't see `2.7.3`, you can install it and set it as the default version:

```sh
rvm install 2.7.3
rvm --default use 2.7.3
```

You should also install the latest versions of `bundler` and `rails`:

```sh
gem install bundler
gem install rails
```

### Install NodeJS

Verify you are running a recent version of Node with:

```sh
node -v
```

If your Node version is less than 14, update it with:

```sh
nvm install node
```

You can also update your npm version with:

```sh
npm i -g npm
```

### Install the Heroku CLI

Follow this guide to install Heroku CLI (if you don't already have it):

- [https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli#download-and-install)

### Install Postgresql

Heroku requires that you use Postgresql for your database instead of SQLite.
Postgresql (or just Postgres for short) is an advanced database management
system with more features than SQLite. If you don't already have it installed,
you'll need to set it up.

To install Postgres for WSL, follow this guide:

- [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-database#install-postgresql][postgresql wsl]

To install Postgres for OSX, you can use Homebrew:

```sh
brew install postgresql
```

Once Postgres has been installed, run this command to start the Postgres
service:

```sh
brew services start postgresql
```

## Troubleshooting

If you ran into any errors along the way, here are some things you can try to
troubleshoot:

- If you got a server connection error when you tried to run `rails db:create`,
  one option for solving this problem for Mac users is to install the Postgres
  app. To do this, first uninstall `postgresql` by running
  `brew remove postgresql`. Next, download the app from the
  [Postgres downloads page][] and install it. Launch the app and click
  "Initialize" to create a new server. You should now be able to run
  `rails db:create`.
- If your app failed to deploy at the build stage, make sure your local
  environment is set up correctly by following the steps at the beginning of
  this lesson. Check that you have the latest versions of Ruby and Bundler, and
  ensure that Postgresql was installed successfully.
- If you deployed successfully, but you ran into issues when you visited the
  site, make sure you migrated and seeded the database. Also, make sure that
  your application works locally and try to debug any issues on your local
  machine before re-deploying. You can also check the logs on the server by
  running `heroku logs`.
