            instructions: "STEP 1: If you have a 12-oz. pitcher, fill it with about 10 oz. of milk; 14 oz. will do in a 20-oz. pitcher. In either case, this is about a pinky's width below the bottom of the nozzle. STEP 2: Angle the pitcher and so that your steamwand is aimed diagonally into the milk's lower right quadrant. STEP 3: Place the tip of the wand a centimeter or two below the milk's surface and turn it on. You'll hear a tearing sound. Don't let it frighten you. After about two seconds, quickly but purposefully submerge the wand below the surface of the milk – not so deep that you hit the side of the pitcher, not so shallow that you continue to create bubbles. STEP 4: Submerging the wand will create the “whirlpool” motion necessary to break down bubbles and create microfoam. STEP 5: Once your milk has reached the appropriate temperature (between 140-145 degrees Fahrenheit), turn off the steam wand. Purge it, and give it a few vigorous wipes with a clean towel. FINAL STEP: To achieve exquisite latte art, begin pouring your milk slowly. Start with a narrow stream to avoid breaking the espresso's crema. Once your drink is about half full, lower your pitcher's spout so that it's almost touching the liquid. This will guarantee strong contrast. Continue pouring. "

            instructions: "STEP 1: Remove your portafilter from the espresso machine’s grouphead. Place it on a scale and tare the weight. STEP 2: Purge your grouphead thoroughly with hot water. STEP 3: For a double shot, grind between 18–21 grams of coffee into your basket. The proper grind is crucial to a balanced, delicious shot of espresso. It might be necessary to adjust its fineness a bit. In general, the grind ought to be quite fine. STEP 4: Distribute the coffee by drawing a finger across it in a series of alternating swipes. It is most effective to alternate sides in a series of 90 degree increments (top to bottom, then left to right, and so on). FINAL STEP: The shot should start with a slow drip, then develop into a gentle, even stream. Near the 30 second mark, the extraction will end, causing the shot to thicken and start “blonding,” or turning yellow. Stop the shot just as this process begins. Some people like to stir a shot after it’s been pulled; some like to sip immediately in order to experience its many layers of flavor. This is up to you. We serve it with a sparkling water back."

            instructions: "STEP 1: Bring enough water to fill the French press to a boil. For a 17-oz press, you'll need about 350 grams (12 ounces). STEP 2: While the water is heating, grind your coffee. French press coffee calls for a coarse, even grind. We recommend starting with a 1:12 coffee-to-water ratio. If you're using 350 grams of water, you’ll want 30 grams of coffee. STEP 3: To start, gently pour twice the amount of water than you have coffee onto your grounds. For example, if you have 30 grams of coffee, you’ll want to start with 60 grams of water. STEP 4: Give the grounds a gentle stir with a bamboo paddle or chopstick. Allow the coffee to bloom for 30 seconds. FINAL STEP: Gently remove your French press from the scale and place it on your counter. Press the filter down. If it’s hard to press, that means your grind is too fine; if the plunger “thunks” immediately down to the floor, it means your grind is too coarse. The sweet spot, pressure-wise, is 15–20 pounds. Not sure what this feels like? Try it out on your bathroom scale."

            instructions: "STEP 1: For a 6-cup moka pot: Grind about 20-22 grams of coffee finer than you would for a pour over, but not quite as fine as you might for a true espresso machine—slightly larger than granulated sugar. STEP 2: Fill the bottom chamber of the moka pot with water until it is level with the valve, about 345 grams. Place the funnel—the coffee grounds receptacle—into the pot. If any water enters the funnel, pour out the excess and replace the funnel. STEP 3: Fill the funnel with the ground coffee, leveling the grounds and wiping the funnel’s rim clean. Do not tamp the grounds. Screw the moka pot’s spouted top on tightly. STEP 4: Place the moka pot on a stove over medium heat. If using a gas stove, make sure the flame is not larger than the base of the pot so as not to expose the handle to heat. FINAL STEP: As the water in the bottom chamber approaches a boil, the pressure will push a stream of coffee steadily up into the upper chamber. You know it’s done when you hear a hissing, gurgling sound. Immediately remove the moka pot from the heat. Let the coffee finish flowing into the upper chamber, and then use caution (and a potholder) to pour your coffee."
